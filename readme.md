Selected algorithms from the book "Astronomical Algorithms"
by Jean Meeus, following the second edition, copyright 1998,
with corrections as of August 10, 2009.

Package meeus is a documentation-only package.  Algorithms are implemented
in subdirectories under meeus, one for each chapter of the book.  In addition
there iss a package "base" with additional functions that may not be described
in the book but are useful with multiple other packages.

See meeus package documentation for a chapter title cross-reference.
